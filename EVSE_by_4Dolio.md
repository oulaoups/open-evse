# Introduction #
This is an example of a 30A Portable EVSE built with the Open EVSE GFCI board, and Advanced power supply.

This should not be attempted by anyone without the required skills and knowledge to work with high voltage.

Open EVSE is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

# Note: EVSE Ground #
NOTE: The Open EVSE control Board must be grounded to the EV/Earth Ground for the pilot to operate correctly.

# Note: Circuit #
If using the L6-30 30A cable/outlet/breaker set the EVSE board to a maximum of 24A.

# Build Information #
Shown below are the parts list for 1 unit, in either Enclosure #1 (Built December 2012) or Enclosure #2 (As of yet not built).  Enclosure #3 (Tiny without display) is not on the parts list.
  * Enclosure #1, Development enclosure Built December 2012
  * Future Development Plans: Add Voltage & Current Measurement.
  * Future Enclosure #2: Narrow transparent blue enclosure.
  * Future Enclosure #3: Tiny sealed unit without a Display.

Quarks to mention:
  * When assembling the display be aware of how stand offs will attach.
  * 10AWG wire is difficult to attach to terminal blocks when the block is mounted inside the enclosure, but easy to attach while the terminal block itself is not yet mounted in the enclosure.
  * Devise a better crimp on terminal block connector than those used.
  * The L6-30 Extension cable is cut in half.  The plug end used with the Open-EVSE.  A 110vac plug is added to the receptical end of the L6 cable for use as an adapter cable for 110vac Level 1 use. (If desired)
  * I tinned (with solder) the ends of the wires that attach to the Open-EVSE so to keep them from fraying when attached to the screw terminals.  Note that depending on the wire gauge used one may need to remove some strands to keep the tinned wire small enough to fit.  None of these carry high power so small gauge wires can be used.
  * I did not solder the internal high power AC connections but rather left them as blade connections.  I am not certain of these connections current carrying capacity and am open to comments and input on whether these should be changed.  I chose not to solder them as I may want to modify things inside this Enclosure #1 which I am using for development purposes.  The other terminal block connections are more than capable of carrying the potentially high currents.
  * More to come...
