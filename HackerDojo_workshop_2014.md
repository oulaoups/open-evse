The event is free, but the Hacker Dojo requests a day-visit donation of $10.

The Hacker Dojo has a variety of useful tools to use on the premises, but will **not** supply any parts or consumables. You must bring **everything** you will need to assemble your project.

Your humble host will happily supply help and expertise.
