# Introduction #

**Update 8/5** The final boards are kitted/built, over the next days or two they will be packaged up, shipping labels printed and they will be on their way...

**Update 7/26** They made it... I will kit them up and build as fast as I can...

**Update 7/25** Remaining 90 are at the sort facility in Burbank they are expected to arrive tomorrow 7/26.

**Update 7/20** Remaining 90 will ship Tuesday 7/23 and should arrive Thursday/Friday...

**Update 7/19** First 10 came in and the first 10 shipped out...I was hoping to get all 100 at once. I'll update when I get tracking info the the other 90.

**Update 7/16** Tracking Estimated Delivery Fri 7/19/2013 10:30 am

**Update 7/16** Finally -  Shipped 2013-07-16 09:17:35

**Update 7/11** Approved test boards via photo, approved the whole batch for shipping. The long wait is just about over. Thanks everyone for hanging in there...

**Update 7/10** Things are finally moving, after every possible delay you could think of gold phoenix has commuted to shipping the first 10 tomorrow via fedex and the second 90 once I approve the test batch. I guess they were a bit off when they quoted 19 days (5 for PCBs production and 14 for assembly) way back on 4/30

**Update 7/1** parts delayed in customs... what else...?

**Update 6/25** Gold Phoenix will ship boards this week, they were delaying production due to a back ordered part. I have plenty so I will add the part on my end.

Their automated system was incorrectly showing 100% complete because they exceeded their 14 day production quote by way too many days...

**Update 6/20** Boards have not arrived yet but should be in any day now...

**Update 5/20** Boards are in production

**Update 4/30** 100 boards ordered for the next batch


This is to reserve a spot (100 available) in the May/June batch of boards.
Boards are built by hand at an average rate of 5-10 boards per week.

Kits will ship first followed by assembled and tested units. Boards will ship in order, unpaid reservations will be skipped until payment is received.
